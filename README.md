## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Jambo, a static site generator, which can be installed with `npm i jambo`
- An Answers experience configured at https://yext.com. This will provide the `experienceKey` and the `apiKey`

### Creating an Answers site

Inside a new directory, initialize jambo with the theme:
```bash
npx jambo init --theme answers-hitchhiker-theme
```

Add a universal search page:
```bash
npx jambo page --name index --template universal-standard
```

Inside config/global_config.json, delete the "//" before "apiKey" and enter your `apiKey`. Do the same for the `experienceKey` inside config/locale_config.json.
You can find examples inside test-site/config.

Build the site:
```bash
npx jambo build && grunt webpack
```

Finally, serve the site:
```bash
npx serve public
```

The site should now be available at http://localhost:5000.

## Custom Jambo Commands

This theme makes the following commands available when Jambo imports this theme.

### Vertical Command

```bash
